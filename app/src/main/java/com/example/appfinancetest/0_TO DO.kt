// Have to build Investment graph
// (minus investment closed after date of closing -> How to close an investment?)
// Date of closing = date of last transaction with the current id (when closed)
// Should I add a validate column in the transaction db?
// Should I create a new db with investID and closed status?
// Import export this new DB?
